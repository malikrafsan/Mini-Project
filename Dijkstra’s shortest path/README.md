# Dijkstra Algorithm to Find Shortest Path
---
## Description
> This program is developed to find shortest path from D to all other vertices. This program uses adjacency matrix as graph representation. This program also uses Dijkstra algorithm for undirected graph. For complete documentation, you can see it in [program's report](Dijkstra-Algorithm-to-Find-Shortest-Path.pdf)
